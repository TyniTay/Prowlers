<p>
Prowl is an important **factor** of student life for Loyola Marymount University. This is what makes the layout and functionality of the site significant. 

Prowl was created in the 90’s and has not been revised or updated since then, except for the change in logo. To sum the site up, it is very outdated.

The design of the site does not appeal to the human eye, there is no aesthetic, the navigation bar is rigid, and the text is too small. Considering the center of the retina does not have any blue cones, this makes the category text design weak. The information presentation is very close together, no dividers and mostly all the same color stacked on top of eachother. This can make finding what the user needs difficult. Not to mention, a few of the options are overlapping and can be confusing for which one does what. 

The site’s menu is also located poorly for our peripheral vision as it is on the center right in blue with no background or button, when all of the navigation tabs are on the center left.

Instead of each navigation menu having a sub menu, it displays a bunch of bundled links all in blue and underlined. This makes it hard to distinguish if this is a link taking you out of prowl, or if it is leading to another page within the website. Also, the amount of blue links is overwhelming and there is way too much text. A lot of these categories can be merged into one page with the proper design.

Another problem with Prowl is the lack of a back button. Instead of going back one page to where you were previously, you have to return to the menu completely. This can be difficult for users who want to return to the previous page, but due to short-term memory, cannot remember the steps to get there. It feels like a maze that leads to a bunch of deadends.

Another aspect that is poorly implemented is there are no errors if you press submit after not selecting anything. It simply just refreshes the page, this could confuse people if they did not know there was input needed.

The site also sends you an email to reset your password every few months, this can be a nuisance as you cannot reuse any of the passwords you have used in the past. This is problematic as users will constantly forget their password or not remember which password is the new password, causing frustration.

### Importance of The Problem

All students and faculty use PROWL for a variety of reasons. The primary use is registration.
95% of students and faculty surveyed stated that they were not satisfied with PROWL’s current state.
PROWL is a very text-heavy, unintuitive design that not only is difficult to navigate, but also does little to cater to neurodiverse populations.
PROWL is currently not optimized at all for mobile users. There is no support or format changes when viewing the website on a phone.
PROWL User Reviews
	Students and professors we surveyed were asked why they are dissatisfied: 

“Feels like I'm stuck in 2005, very text heavy, I just hate looking at it. Definitely needs an update or 2 to allow users to better navigate their excessive menus”
“I don't understand how the categories are organized and navigating the interface is very unintuitive.”
“Navigation through Banner is incredibly difficult, cannot open multiple tabs in Banner, it's always one tab and gets overwritten, searching through classes is difficult and not user friendly, neither is looking at the details of the courses.”
“This tool is just terrible. From the very moment you log in, it is difficult to find what you need to do the work for which you accessed it”
Existing Solutions
Existing solutions can be seen in similar portals for schools and other organizations that utilize less text-heavy layouts and, instead, focus on accessibility.

Below is an example with large, easy to understand sections for each link and tabs on the left so they are seen first.

While the page below presents a lot of information, the layout and color design does a good job of not overwhelming the user.


### Target/Primary Users

LMU students are the primary users of PROWL. We fall into two subcategories: undergraduate students and law students.
Students are the most obvious set of primary users, as one of the four tabs on PROWL's current menu is labeled "student services." We use prowl to access incredibly important information about the status of various engagements at LMU.

LMU faculty should also be considered target users of PROWL. Several professors told us firsthand that they rely on it for many tasks. In fact, their frustration with the interface seemed much stronger than that of many students. It could be argued that professors are more impacted by the interface than students in the long term because they never graduate out of LMU. A common task that professors reported using PROWL for is accessing student records for academic advising.

### Secondary Users

Many students, particularly younger students enrolled in LMU's undergraduate program, allow parents or guardians access to their student account. Parents navigating PROWL to help their child succeed in school should be taken into consideration, but they are secondary users because the system is not designed to manage parent information.

LMU staff who receive questions about the interface from LMU students may never interact with PROWL directly, but they should be considered secondary users because they require an understanding of the interface. In order to guide students effectively, staff, such as those working in the office or registrar, should have a thorough understanding of the tasks associated with their office. 

### Other Stakeholders

PROWL is the platform for a huge number of important tasks that students and faculty carry out at LMU. Because students and faculty are the core of university culture, all members of the current LMU community could be considered, at least, tertiary stakeholders in PROWL. Two examples of these stakeholders, who never interact with the interface but are influenced by it, would be high-level LMU administrators and staff working in campus maintenance. PROWL impacts the lives and schedules of students and faculty who, in turn, impact the jobs of these administrators and staff. LMU administrators may also have the final say in decisions about the interface.

Further User Analysis: *Platform:
PROWL is accessible through any standard web browser to any user with the proper verification. This means that users will be accessing the page through personal mobile devices, personal computers, and the computers provided by LMU in public spaces. It should be noted here that PROWL is currently not formatted to function on a mobile web browser--a clear problem with the interface that should be addressed. 

*Please note that the above also applies to the "task environment."
 
Further User Analysis: *Location:
LMU has a main physical campus. However, because of PROWL's browser accessibility, the interface should not be designed with the only campus in mind. As we are seeing play out today, a large variety of circumstances can necessitate that students be able to use PROWL effectively from anywhere in the world. 
That said, PROWL should be designed with minimal noise alerts, as many students will be accessing it through university computers in designated quiet spaces.

*Please note that the above also applies to the "task environment." 

### Further User Analysis: 
#### Age

The expected ages of various PROWL user demographics, based off of internet research, are as follows:
- Undergraduate students: under 25
- Law Students: 22 to 24
- Faculty: 55 on average
- Parents: likely in 40s or 50s
  
Undergraduate and law students are at a relatively young expected age. They will most likely be very familiar with electronic user interface conventions. However, the interface should not be streamlined so much that it alienates parents, faculty, and more mature LMU students. 
Further User Analysis: Economic Standing:
LMU is a private school, so it is safe to assume that many users of PROWL will be from an affluent background. Affluence will not impact the users' access to PROWL in any way.
There are also a large number of students receiving scholarships and/or financial aid to attend LMU. There is not much that can be done to help students who struggle with accessing PROWL through personal devices, but computers are provided for them by the university. 
It may streamline PROWL to hide or remove the financial aid and scholarship sections of the interface for those they do not apply to. However, this may discourage them from accessing these resources should their circumstances change in the future.

### Issues and constraints of the project

The biggest constraint impacting the design of a new PROWL interface is the larger LMU interface within which PROWL exists. PROWL is accessed through the My LMU homepage and serves as a portal to numerous other pages in LMU's system. Many of the features on any given number of these pages may be more convenient to users as a part of PROWL. However, it is beyond the scope of this project to change the other pages. Having these features in multiple locations may create more confusion than is worth including them in PROWL. 
A new PROWL must also be able to integrate into LMU's human interface. PROWL's services should be available to users all-year-round, meaning the opportunity to retrain users on a new system is very slim. Even if the new system is intuitive, some confusion will inevitably arise when it replaces the old one. Therefore, the new system should maintain enough of the old system's architecture to remain as familiar as possible, without sacrificing design.

### Implications for Future Design

![Example1](/images/exampleprowl2.png)
A new design for PROWL should not only be easier to use and simpler to navigate, but familiar alongside myLMU. With the large number of returning students and faculty who are already accustomed to myLMU, it is reasonable to create PROWL 2.0 with myLMU in mind. Using myLMU as a reference, we should design a new web page with less confusing tabs and mobile compatibility. Our research and analysis of Prowl has shown us the important role design plays in a user’s experience.
